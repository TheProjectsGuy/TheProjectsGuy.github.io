This is a template I use to create projects and docs. This page is to give a special emphasis on docs. I'll be creating a project named `FeatMF`.

## Pre-requisites

You must have the following

- A [github](https://github.com/) account. I prefer to have SSH keys and `gh` [CLI](https://cli.github.com/) setup.
- A [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) account with GitHub (or other platforms) connected.
- For environment management, you have [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [Python poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.
- Knowledge of git, bash, python environments, documentation. Some reference is included below.

## Steps

Do the following

### Step 1: Setup the empty repository locally

```bash
mkdir FeatMF && cd $_
git init -b main
touch README.rst
```

Add other things like IDE files, `.gitignore` files, etc. We'll choose the [GNU LGPL v3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/) license.

Add the first commit

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "First commit"
```

### Step 2: Upload the repository to GitHub

- On GitHub (or any git hosting platform), create repository with no README or LICENSE (everything will be uploaded from local).
- Add remote

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/TheProjectsGuy/FeatMF.git
    ```

- Push the changes to GitHub

    ```bash
    git push origin -u main
    ```

### Step 3: Setup Python Poetry

1. Setup Python poetry for this project (using Python from `pyenv`)

    - Initialize it (an interactive menu setup follows)

        ```bash
        poetry init
        ```

        I choose python `3.8` for this project (supported by multiple libraries), but my OS has python `3.10.6`. I do not prefer using the system interpreter (unless it's absolutely necessary)

    - We'll create a `pyenv` for python `3.8` and make the local folder use that python all the time.

        ```bash
        # Depending on what you have in `~/.zshrc`
        pyenv-init || eval "$(pyenv init -)"
        # Install Python 3.8
        pyenv install 3.8
        pyenv local 3.8
        python --version    # Should be 3.8.*
        ```

        I like to use my system python by default, so I have a `pyenv-init` function in my `~/.zshrc` to initialize `pyenv` (same init command).

    - Make sure poetry uses this Python

        ```bash
        poetry env use python
        # Test that this worked
        poetry shell
        ```

2. Install core libraries through poetry

    In `pyproject.toml` file, add the dependencies. For now, we'll just install the latest versions of `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-contrib-python`, and PyTorch (version 1.13).

    ```toml
    python = "^3.8.0"
    numpy = "*"
    scipy = "*"
    matplotlib = "*"
    opencv-contrib-python = "*"
    torch = "^1.13"
    torchvision = "*"
    torchaudio = "*"
    ```

    Such wildcard entries are better left to the development builds. Make them concrete before releasing this to public.
    Run the poetry commands to install everything

    ```bash
    poetry install
    poetry update
    ```

3. Show the installed packages as a tree

    ```bash
    poetry show --tree
    ```

### Step 4: Create Documentation

#### Create Local Docs

1. Create entry in the `pyproject.toml` file

    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.group.docs]
    optional = true

    [tool.poetry.group.docs.dependencies]
    sphinx = ">= 5.2"
    ```

    And install everything

    ```bash
    poetry install --with docs
    ```

2. Create folder with basic quickstart

    ```bash
    cd FeatMF
    poetry shell
    sphinx-quickstart docs
    ```

    Put the `docs/build` folder in `.gitignore`

3. Build the docs

    ```bash
    sphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html
    ```

    See the preview in `./docs/build/html/index.html` file

#### Choose a Theme

1. Install the theme. We'll use the [rtc-theme](https://sphinx-themes.org/sample-sites/sphinx-rtd-theme/)

    In `pyproject.toml` add the theme (under the `docs` group dependencies)

    ```toml
    sphinx-rtd-theme = ">= 1.0"
    ```

    Update poetry

    ```bash
    poetry install --with docs
    poetry update
    ```

2. Use that theme

    In `./docs/source/conf.py`, add/change the following

    ```py
    html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
    ```

    Rebuild the site

    ```bash
    sphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html
    ```

#### Deploy

Deploy on [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/)

1. Push all the latest changes to remote (GitHub)
2. Import project and reach the [dashboard](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/).
3. Choose the repository in the list.

#### Recommendations

- For (offline) reference, you can optionally save the entire theme (source)

    ```bash
    cd /scratch
    wget --recursive --no-parent https://sphinx-themes.org/sample-sites/sphinx-rtd-theme/
    ```
