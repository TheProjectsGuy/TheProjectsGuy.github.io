I'm an engineer and a researcher in the field of **robotics**. I finished my M.S. by research (CSE) from RRC, IIIT Hyderabad under the guidance of [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/).

My experience is in computer vision fields (mostly pertaining to robotics): visual place recognition, SLAM, image descriptor and feature matching, etc. I'm also interested in other areas such as perception, deep learning, planning and navigation, and system design. I like to work on incrementally solving important problems rather than largely solving artificial problems.

I sometimes share [paper summaries on HuggingFace Papers](https://huggingface.co/collections/TheProjectsGuy/summaries-6521396de3419abdcf55c4f7). I also like other areas of computer science: software development (you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/TheProjectsGuy)), cloud computing, and computer hardware (I've build many systems)

My hobbies include finance, reading, and listening to music. I am also interested in Indian culture, history, and cuisines.
