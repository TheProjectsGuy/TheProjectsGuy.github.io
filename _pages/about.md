I use Computer Vision to solve complex problems in Robotics. Currently, I'm pursuing my M.S. by Research at RRC, IIIT Hyderabad under [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/).

My core work is using local, semi-global, global, and sequential descriptors to solve Visual Place Recognition (VPR) problems in **SLAM**. I'm also interested in Perception, Deep Learning, Planning and Navigation, and Robotic simulations. I like to effectively deploy something that works rather than spend time on something that won't.

I like to develop software (and document it well enough) - you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/TheProjectsGuy). I have an extreme fascination with computers (I've personally built four systems), and I never miss an opportunity to learn more about them. My interests and experience include various aspects of computer science.

My hobbies include finance, reading, listening to music, and walking. I am also interested in Indian history, cuisines, and culture.

> If you have benefited from (or like) my work, or simply want to be generous, please consider to financially assist me through UPI (India) `theprojectsguy@ybl`, [buy me a coffee](https://liberapay.com/avneesh_m/donate), [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/TheProjectsGuy), or [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/avneesh_m/donate). I'll be very grateful for your help.
